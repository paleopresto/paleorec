Accuracy Calculation for the PaleoClimate Recommendation System
===============================================================

The metrics implemented for the recommendation system is 'Hit Ratio and MRR'.

Hit Ratio is a measure of whether the ground truth item is present in the recommendation list generated by the model. The indicator function return 1 if the item is present else returns 0.
Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) takes into account the position of the ground truth item in the recommendation list. It calculated the reciprocal of the rank of where the ground truth item appers in the ranked recommendation list. 1st item will have MRR = 1/1, 2nd item will have MRR = 1/2 and so on..
