Recommender system for paleoclimate data

Created a First-order Markov Chain Model to predict the next item in sequence.
We are currently considering 2 types of sequence chains
    archiveType -> proxyObservationType -> units
    archiveType -> proxyObservationType -> interpretation/variable -> interpretation/VariableDetail
